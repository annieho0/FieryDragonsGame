# Fiery Dragon Game

## Description
This is a Java-based game involving dragons and other animals. The game is developed using Java and Swing for the graphical interface. The game involves different types of cards, such as Baby Dragons, Salamanders, and Spiders, and positioning them on a circular board.

## Aim of this Sprint
