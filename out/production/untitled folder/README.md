# Fiery Dragon Game

## Description
This is a Java-based game involving dragons and other animals. The game is developed using Java and Swing for the graphical interface. The game involves different types of cards, such as Baby Dragons, Salamanders, and Spiders, and positioning them on a circular board.

## Aim of this Sprint
The aim of this sprint is to have the initial gameboard set up and also implement the flipping card functionality so that when a card is clicked, it is turned over and an image of an animal is displayed. When clicked again, it becomes covered again.

## How to Run
Install JDK17 to run the .jar file through java -jar sprint1.jar
